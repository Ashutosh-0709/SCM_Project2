## Premise

In this project, I have leveraged R (RStudio) and ARIMA modeling to create a forecast for the "Paint" product based on previous demand. We start with preparation of demand data and its analysis to identify trends and seasonality. Next, we determine ARIMA model parameters and finallly generate the forecast for the product. We also evaluate the forecast by checking the distribution of the residuals. The Forecast is generated for the next 12 months (until 2024).
